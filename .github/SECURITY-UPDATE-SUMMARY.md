# GitHub Actions Security Update - Summary

## 🔒 Security Issue Fixed

**Problem**: GitHub Actions were using major version tags (e.g., `@v4`, `@v1`) instead of pinned patch versions, which creates security and reproducibility risks.

**Solution**: Updated all GitHub Actions to their latest specific patch versions.

## 📋 Actions Updated

| Action | Before | After | Security Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| `actions/checkout` | `@v4` | `@v4.3.0` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain` | `@v1` | `@v1.10.1` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions/setup-python` | `@v4` | `@v4.8.0` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions/setup-node` | `@v4` | `@v4.1.0` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions/cache` | `@v3` | `@v3.3.3` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions/github-script` | `@v7` | `@v7.0.1` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

1. **Immutable Builds**: Specific versions ensure the same action code runs every time
2. **Supply Chain Security**: Prevents automatic updates that could introduce vulnerabilities
3. **Reproducibility**: Builds are consistent across different runs and environments
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear visibility into which exact version of each action is being used

# GitHub Actions Security Update - Summary

## 🔒 Security Issue Fixed

**Problem**: GitHub Actions were using major version tags (e.g., `@v4`, `@v1`) instead of pinned patch versions, which creates security and reproducibility risks.

**Solution**: Updated all GitHub Actions to their latest specific patch versions.

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: actions/cache Deprecation

**⚠️ URGENT**: GitHub is deprecating `actions/cache` v1, v2, and v3 on **February 1st, 2025**

**Problem**: Our workflows were using deprecated `actions/cache@v3.3.3` which will cause workflow failures after the deprecation date.

**Solution**: Updated to `actions/cache@v4.2.4` which uses the new cache service backend.

### Critical Impact Avoided

- ❌ **Without update**: All workflows would fail after February 1st, 2025
- ✅ **With update**: Workflows continue to function with improved performance and reliability

## 📋 Actions Updated

| Action | Before | After | Security Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| `actions/checkout` | `@v4` | `@v4.3.0` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain` | `@v1` | `@v1.10.1` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions/setup-python` | `@v4` | `@v4.8.0` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions/setup-node` | `@v4` | `@v4.1.0` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |
| `actions/cache` | `@v3.3.3` | `@v4.2.4` | 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Prevents workflow failures |
| `actions/github-script` | `@v7` | `@v7.0.1` | ✅ Pinned to specific release |

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

1. **Immutable Builds**: Specific versions ensure the same action code runs every time
2. **Supply Chain Security**: Prevents automatic updates that could introduce vulnerabilities
3. **Reproducibility**: Builds are consistent across different runs and environments
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear visibility into which exact version of each action is being used
5. **🚨 Continuity**: Prevents total workflow failure from actions/cache deprecation

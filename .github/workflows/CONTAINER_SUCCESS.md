# Container Build and Push Success! ðŸŽ‰

## âœ… What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Fixed Docker Authentication Issues**
- âœ… Removed problematic `credsStore: "desktop"` from Docker config
- âœ… Successfully logged into GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- âœ… Authentication working with `GITHUB_GCR_TOKEN` environment variable

### 2. **Built and Pushed Container**
- âœ… **Built**: `ghcr.io/pmpetit/postgresql_pglinter:pgrx`
- âœ… **Pushed**: Successfully uploaded to GitHub Container Registry
- âœ… **Verified**: Container can be pulled and is accessible

### 3. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**
- âœ… Added proper container credentials for private GHCR access
- âœ… Both `build` and `installcheck` jobs now have authentication
- âœ… Uses `${{ github.actor }}` and `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

## ðŸ“¦ Container Details

**Image**: `ghcr.io/pmpetit/postgresql_pglinter:pgrx`
**Size**: Multi-layer (optimized with cached layers)
**Base**: Rocky Linux 8 with Rust and pgrx development tools
**Digest**: `sha256:a38fbd3205bbb0d303c2e88af94f55fe1f29ab77f2e3feb3fbb9f811029b25d3`

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test!

Your GitHub Actions workflow should now work properly. The container is available and the workflow has the correct authentication.

### Next Steps:

1. **Test the workflow:**
   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "fix: add container authentication and push pgrx image"
   git push
   ```

2. **Or trigger manually:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run build_and_test_pgver.yml -f pgver=pg16
   ```

3. **Monitor the workflow:**
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab in your repository
   - Watch for successful container pull and workflow execution

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Summary

### Docker Login Status
- âœ… Authenticated with GHCR
- âœ… Credentials stored (unencrypted warning is normal for testing)

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- âœ… Container authentication configured
- âœ… Both build and test jobs use private container
- âœ… Proper token scopes for GHCR access

### Build Script
- âœ… `build_and_push_to_ghcr.sh` available for future builds
- âœ… Supports multiple environment variable names for tokens
- âœ… Builds pgrx development container from `docker/pgrx/Dockerfile`

The container is now available and your workflows should run successfully! ðŸŽ¯

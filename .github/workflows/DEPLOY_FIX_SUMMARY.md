# Deploy Workflow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Deprecated Action Versions
- **Fixed**: Updated `actions/checkout@v3` â†’ `actions/checkout@v4`
- **Fixed**: Updated `actions/download-artifact@v3` â†’ `actions/download-artifact@v4`
- **Fixed**: Updated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` â†’ `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

### 2. âœ… Project Name Updates
- **Fixed**: Changed `postgresql_anonymizer` references to `pglinter`
- **Fixed**: Updated artifact paths from `anon-*` to `pglinter-*`
- **Fixed**: Updated package naming to use `pglinter_*` format

### 3. âœ… Workflow Improvements

#### Enhanced Deploy Strategy
- **Tags**: Packages uploaded to GitHub Releases (permanent)
- **Manual Dispatch**: Packages uploaded as workflow artifacts (7-day retention)

#### Added Validation
- **Package Verification**: Checks if .deb and .rpm packages exist before deployment
- **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful guidance when artifacts are missing

#### Better Input Handling
- **Updated**: PostgreSQL version input now expects format like `pg16` instead of just `16`
- **Consistent**: Matches format used in other workflows

## Updated File

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```yaml
# Key improvements:
- Updated all action versions to v4
- Added package verification step
- Conditional deployment (releases for tags, artifacts for manual)
- Better error handling and user guidance
- Consistent naming with pglinter project
```

## Usage

### For Tag-based Releases
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# Workflow automatically triggered, packages uploaded to GitHub Releases
```

### For Manual Testing
```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f pgver=pg16
# Workflow uploads packages as artifacts for testing
```

## Dependencies

This workflow expects:
1. **Artifacts**: A `built-packages` artifact from a previous build job
2. **Permissions**: `contents: read` and `packages: write`
3. **Structure**: Packages in `target/release/pglinter-{pgver}/` directory

## Integration

- **Standalone**: Can be run independently for manual deployment
- **Integrated**: The `build_and_test_pgver.yml` workflow includes its own deployment steps
- **Flexible**: Supports both automated (tag-based) and manual deployment scenarios

All deprecated action versions have been resolved! ðŸŽ‰
